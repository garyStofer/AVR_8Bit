The Attiny project is a Atmel Studio 6 project. 
Open the .atsln file and choose the proper configuartioon "release or debug" under "Solution properties" Configuartion mananger 
before building and programming of a device.

The program is compiled by:  AVRGCC - 3.4.0.65, AVR Toolchain 8 Bit,Version: 3.4.0.663 - GCC  4.6.2

ATtiny 4313 Fuse settings are as follows and need to be programmed with the ICD (6pin) communication protocol.
~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-~-
EXTENDED = 0xFF 
HIGH = 0xDF, or 0x5F for DebugWire enable
LOW = 0xE4 

No lock bits set at this time.

Programming of the device can be accomplished via the ICD or the Debugwire communciation protocol, however atmel devices default to the 
6 wire ICD protocol, and therefore the fuses have to be set with that program initailly.
